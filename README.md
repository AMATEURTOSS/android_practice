This store contains two apps.  
* rm_message
* certifying_number_auto_input

## rm_message
This is my first android app project  
This project is designed for my mother who removes the sms text of the ad one by one.  
This app deletes all SMS ad texts.

Unfortunately, I didn't know until the project was finished that deleting messages is not a security policy.  
This repository is the remains of a project with such a story.  

## certifying_number_auto_input
this is my second android app project  
When the authentication text comes, it automatically extracts the number and copies it to the clipboard.  
It is a completed project and performs the functions I wanted.
